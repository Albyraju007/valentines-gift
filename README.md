# Our First Valentine’s Day

A small, deliberately overengineered static website built for one very specific human.

This project counts down to February 14, 12:00 AM IST and unlocks a surprise at midnight.  
No frameworks. No backend. No tracking. Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and intent.

## What This Is

A time-locked Valentine’s Day experience.

Before midnight:
- A live countdown to 14 Feb, 12:00 AM IST.

At midnight:
- The page unlocks a hidden surprise.

It is intentionally simple.
It is intentionally personal.
It is intentionally not scalable.

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling and layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (countdown logic)
- GitHub Pages (free static hosting)

No build tools. No dependencies. No nonsense.

## How It Works

- The countdown targets `2026-02-14T00:00:00+05:30`.
- Time difference is calculated in milliseconds.
- When the difference reaches zero or below:
  - The timer freezes.
  - The hidden section becomes visible.
  - The headline updates.

Everything runs client-side.

## Why This Exists

Because meaningful things do not require complexity.
Because sometimes effort matters more than scale.
Because building something small for someone specific is still building.

---

## Deployment

Hosted via GitHub Pages.

No domain.
No server.
No recurring cost.
Just a link.
